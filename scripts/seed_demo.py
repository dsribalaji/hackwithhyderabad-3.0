"""Seed a demo bank with a multi-week customer history.

This builds the 'learning curve' the demo shows: the same question asked
against an empty bank (generic answer) vs this seeded bank (personalized).

Usage:
    python scripts/seed_demo.py [--bank shopmind-demo] [--scenario shopmind]

Scenarios are just seed data — swap in your own for a different project idea.
